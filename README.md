# python-cuda-interface-study

The goal of the project is to play around and create a simplistic boilerplate code for Python-C++ and Python-CUDA integrations.

Todo:
- [x] builable C++ code
- [ ] Python wrapper for the C++ code
- [ ] setup.py for Python package
- [ ] simple and runable CUDA kernel
- [ ] Python wrapper and setup.py work with CUDA
- [ ] find a way to return GPU tensor from C++ directly to Python/pytorch (without copy to host)


Finally:
- [ ] simple API
- [ ] Dockerfile and docker-compose
